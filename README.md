## Abstract

- To extract powerful spatial-spectral features, we design a lightweight attention mechanism that explicitly models the relationships among multiple channels in the spatial-spectral dimension. This method enables finer-grained spatial feature modeling, highlighting key spatial-spectral channels for the current MI task.
- To capture long-term temporal features from high temporal resolution EEG signals, we develop a Multi-scale Variance Pooling (MVP) module with large kernels. Compared to commonly used transformers, the MVP module is parameter-free and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show that MVP outperforms transformers, indicating its potential as an alternative for capturing long-term temporal features in EEG signal decoding and real-time BCI applications.
- To overcome the small-sample issue, we propose a novel Dual Prototype Learning (DPL) method to optimize feature space distribution, making same-class features more compact and different-class features more separated. The DPL acts as a regularization technique, enhancing the model’s generalization ability and classification performance. Furthermore, the DPL can be easily integrated with existing advanced methods, serving as a general approach to enhance model performance. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply the prototype learning to EEG-MI decoding. We believe it offers valuable insights that will inspire further advancements in the field.
- We conduct experiments on three benchmark public datasets to evaluate the superiority of the proposed SST-DPN against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI decoding methods Additionally, comprehensive ablation experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of each module in the proposed method.

## Requirements:

- python 3.10
- pytorch 2.12
- braindecode 0.8.1
- moabb 1.1.0

## Data download and preprocessing

All data will be downloaded automatically except for the BCI3-4A dataset. Download the BCI3-4A dataset and put all files in the directory defined in load_data.py.

## Training
python train.py

*Since my original project was highly integrated, this training code has been simplified with the help of ChatGPT. I have tested it and confirmed that it can run directly, but I cannot guarantee its complete correctness.*

### Kaggle notebook

To reproduce the full training pipeline on Kaggle without cloning this repository:

1. Create a new Kaggle Notebook (GPU optional but recommended) and enable **Internet** access.
2. Copy the cells from [`kaggle_notebook_cells.md`](kaggle_notebook_cells.md) into the notebook in order.
3. Adjust any run parameters directly in **Cell&nbsp;2** (`CONFIG`) to experiment with different subjects, splits, or hyper-parameters.
4. Execute the cells sequentially. **Cell&nbsp;3** downloads the BNCI 2a/2b archives from the official BBCI links, **Cells&nbsp;4–7** recreate all project modules inside the notebook, **Cells&nbsp;8–10** mirror `train.py`'s two-phase training and evaluation flow, and **Cell&nbsp;11** sweeps every BNCI 2b subject to produce a per-subject metrics table plus dataset averages.
5. Optional: add extra cells after Cell&nbsp;11 if you want to port the `compare_model/` baselines or save the trained weights from `/kaggle/working/best_model.pth`.

Because every module is defined inside the notebook cells, the workflow no longer depends on cloning the Git repository—uploading code files as a Kaggle dataset is no longer required.
## Rusults and Visualization

In the following datasets we have used the official criteria for dividing the training and test sets:

- [BCI4-2A](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/) -acc 84.11%
- [BCI4-2B](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/) -acc 86.65%
- [BCI3-4A](https://bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_IVa.html) -acc 82.03%
