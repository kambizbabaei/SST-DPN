## Abstract

- To extract powerful spatial-spectral features, we design a lightweight attention mechanism that explicitly models the relationships among multiple channels in the spatial-spectral dimension. This method enables finer-grained spatial feature modeling, highlighting key spatial-spectral channels for the current MI task.
- To capture long-term temporal features from high temporal resolution EEG signals, we develop a Multi-scale Variance Pooling (MVP) module with large kernels. Compared to commonly used transformers, the MVP module is parameter-free and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show that MVP outperforms transformers, indicating its potential as an alternative for capturing long-term temporal features in EEG signal decoding and real-time BCI applications.
- To overcome the small-sample issue, we propose a novel Dual Prototype Learning (DPL) method to optimize feature space distribution, making same-class features more compact and different-class features more separated. The DPL acts as a regularization technique, enhancing the model’s generalization ability and classification performance. Furthermore, the DPL can be easily integrated with existing advanced methods, serving as a general approach to enhance model performance. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply the prototype learning to EEG-MI decoding. We believe it offers valuable insights that will inspire further advancements in the field.
- We conduct experiments on three benchmark public datasets to evaluate the superiority of the proposed SST-DPN against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI decoding methods Additionally, comprehensive ablation experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of each module in the proposed method.

## Requirements:

- python 3.10
- pytorch 2.12
- braindecode 0.8.1
- moabb 1.1.0

## Data download and preprocessing

All data will be downloaded automatically except for the BCI3-4A dataset. Download the BCI3-4A dataset and put all files in the directory defined in load_data.py.

## Training
python train.py

*Since my original project was highly integrated, this training code has been simplified with the help of ChatGPT. I have tested it and confirmed that it can run directly, but I cannot guarantee its complete correctness.*

### Kaggle notebook

To run the project inside a Kaggle Notebook, follow the step-by-step cell outline in [`kaggle_notebook_cells.md`](kaggle_notebook_cells.md). The outline mirrors `train.py`, installs the required packages, and exposes every run parameter as an editable local variable so you can experiment without touching the source files or modifying `train.py`. The document also lists how each cell maps to the core repository modules (data loading, model definition, training loops, and evaluation) so you can confirm the full training flow is represented before running any optional experiments such as the `compare_model/` baselines. After configuring the run, the dedicated dataset-download cell fetches the BNCI competition archives (2a or 2b) directly from the official BBCI links and caches them under `/kaggle/working/moabb_datasets`, so the later data-loading cell can reuse them without any manual uploads.
## Rusults and Visualization

In the following datasets we have used the official criteria for dividing the training and test sets:

- [BCI4-2A](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/) -acc 84.11%
- [BCI4-2B](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/) -acc 86.65%
- [BCI3-4A](https://bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_IVa.html) -acc 82.03%
